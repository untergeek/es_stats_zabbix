# Contributing Documentation and Code Changes

If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to
es_stats, and you think it will take more than a few minutes to produce
the fix (ie; write code), it is worth discussing the change with other users and
developers first! You can reach us via [github](https://github.com/untergeek/es_stats_zabbix/issues),
or via IRC (#untergeek on freenode irc)
